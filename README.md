# Rentify
Developed a fully functional platform called Rentify, modeled after Airbnb, for property rentals using the MERN stack. The application features a responsive front-end built with React, enabling dynamic user interactions. The back-end consists of RESTful APIs developed with Node.js and Express, which handle user authentication.
